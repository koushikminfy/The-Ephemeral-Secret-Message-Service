# 🕵️ Secret Message Service (Basic)

A simple Express.js backend that allows users to post, retrieve, and manage **ephemeral secret messages**. These messages are stored only in memory and vanish if the server is restarted.

> 🚧 This is a basic project meant for learning Express, Zod validation, and API fundamentals. No database is used.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (Runtime)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) (Validation)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/secret-message-basic.git
cd secret-message-basic
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Run the Server

```bash
bun start
```

Server will start at:

```
http://localhost:3000

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": 0,
    "message": "The eagle has landed and is hungry.",
    "createdAt": "2025-06-22T15:45:38.489Z"
  }
}
```

### ❌ POST `/messages` – Validation Failure

## 🧠 Key Learning

This project demonstrates:

* Express basics: routing, middleware, JSON handling
* Server-side validation with Zod
* Error handling (including validation errors)
* Limitations of in-memory data (all data is lost when server restarts)

---

## 📚 Next Steps

* [ ] Structure project into controllers, routes, middleware (Part 2)
* [ ] Replace in-memory storage with MongoDB or PostgreSQL
* [ ] Add DELETE `/messages/:id` endpoint
* [ ] Implement expiration/auto-deletion of messages
